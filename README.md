# Machine Learning Examples: Breast Cancer and Iris Classification

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic machine learning workflows using popular datasets. The examples cover classification tasks with the Breast Cancer dataset and the Iris dataset, showcasing various techniques such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), feature scaling, and performance evaluation metrics.
